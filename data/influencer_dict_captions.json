For 14 years I climbed in Indian Creek a minimum of 5 months a year. I had the pleasure of meeting Eric Bjornstadt one season. Another season I climbed all wide cracks.

I've been honored to teach for several years with on her delightful Crack Clinics, & share my passion & love for desert cracks with others: the lifestyle, the dirt, & the smiles. I've trained my heart out, sent 30 pitches in a day on several occasions. I've gotten to fail, miserably, on these cracks, too. I've won, I've lost. Exactly 1 year ago, I decided to give it a break... My finger joints needed a break, & I was ready to embark on a new journey of marriage, a new (dream) job, & getting out of my comfort zone in other ways, athletically, emotionally, spiritually. I don't climb very hard right now, in fact. I'm weak in some ways, but miles stronger in others. However, I draw on all of the lessons I've learned in climbing, from succeeding to failing, to persevering with tenacity, to consistently trying hard, to battering my body & mind, to figuring out the challenge, to facing the challenge, to believing in myself. The lessons I've learned from climbing have ultimately made me a better human, & inspired me to grow in ways unimaginable. So, thanks Climbing. You weren't just a \"hobby\" after all!

After two days of climbing this one with a variety of routes, on the 3rd I finally buckled down and rocked through it.

Thanks and Auntie Lara for putting together a little post", "\"Running in a cloud this morning gave me a strange sense of freedom, I didn't know if the track was going up a mountain or down into a valley instead of thinking about what lies ahead I just focused on each step and that present moment... it's a great way to run/live\" ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------", "\"Despite feeling under the weather and less than ideal weather forecasts, I think I'll go chase another mountain. A new peak in a new range with some new faces...let's do this.\" ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------", "\"This is the fuel to my work week. I'm so fortunate to love what I do every day, but I wouldn't be my best self doing it without a mountain recharge each weekend.\" ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------", "\"My grief is a difficult hike; like climbing a mountain. When looking up, it seems insurmountable. Thinking about all that elevation gain, those long switchbacks, roots and rocks and exposed ledges. But it's there. Sometimes it sucks and I'm tired and the hard parts seem like they'll never ever end-but they eventually do. And usually there's something beautiful at the end (like an alpine lake or healing or both). Even though I'm a slow hiker, I'm incredibly strong. I keep taking one step at a time. Out here I feel like I can finally take full breaths of air. Out here, my mind is finally quiet. Gone are the doubts and anxieties. Here, I'm sure of who I am and where I came from.\" ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------", "\"I used to buffer myself from risk. I'd pad myself with excuses. I'd stick to the middle of the path, the road, the crowd. I'd never go first and I'd secretly hope time would run out so I wouldn't have to go last either. I didn't jump in the water. I didn't peer over the edge. I didn't make waves. I was a lemming. Going to the edge of my perpetual comfort zone was not an option. It wasn't a place for a timid cat like me. Or so I thought. Until one day, out of the blue, with a goose egg on my head from a hard fall on an icy morning run and a broken heart from a relationship gone sideways, I googled \"adventure\" and promptly booked a flight to the Yukon. To the edge. To the Tombstone Mountains. Waaaaaaay outside of my comfort zone. On the other side of reason. Two months later, when I jumped out of the helicopter, blades circling overhead, with all the wrong gear and not enough food in the middle of the alpine on to lichen-covered rocks under a midnight sun, it was clear to me what my life had been missing. Madness. It had been missing madness. And I wouldn't spend another day without a little crazy ever again.\" ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------"], "posts": ["BZ7WEaRhH6p", "BZ34zxLBART", "BZ1fpCSBYbE", "BZyXtN9hj9z", "BZxCaODBsW6", "BZl7t4wBXVI", "BZjYttZh0hj", "BZgdrzJBT-0", "BZeWOLEhU7w", "BZcXDZzhQpN", "BZTTqWrBnwB", "BZEG6YfhUbQ", "BY3VBt7hg2n", "BY02CPnBmXq", "BYpZQnbhiCZ", "BYWwL77hyjP", "BYUpR86hZRy", "BYQrrfzBqy6", "BYJ-2oZh-ZH", "BYHe3DihAGE", "BX1Hx2DBVQh"]}, "1493726900": {"caption": ["Can't wait for my adventure next week with this one.."], "posts": ["BYbjwiQgNy0"]}, "2164771861": {"caption": ["doing her thing near Bangs Canyon, CO.

We are pegged to compete against everyone around us but what matters the most is whether you did, or are your doing, your best in the best way you can with balance and perspective. Set your standard and your goals for what you want to be, do, achieve and align yourself with that-not with what the next person is doing or being. Goals will shift as life evolves. Your priorities will change, you will create different targets. Don't get stuck in the FOMO of what others are doing. Captain your ship. A lot of what I \"achieved\" from a young age was against \"bad odds\" and with \"stiff competition\". But my attitude was clear that if I was going to achieve something, it would be because I had done what was needed in order to do get there-irrespective of the statistics. That held up with sports, academia, my career and the arts. Sometimes your best on a given day doesn't land you on top of the perceived pile. You don't always \"win\". That may undoubtedly be disappointing and more in the moment - but ask \"what do I take from this for next time?\" Don't look to others for comparison and to be more negative about yourself - find inspiration and learning. Luck/Bad Luck do come into play for reasons out of your control. That is \"life\": It happens to the best of people and has little to do with your worth and capability.

Nature does no such thing. Outdoors, the feasibility of a climb is not guaranteed, which is both a frustration and an opportunity. Some people excel at trying things even if they don't know if it'll go. I'm not one of them, but I'm always trying to get better at it. .

Tommy Caldwell was presenting. In his presentation, Tommy glosses over his time in Kyrgyzstan when he was captured during a climbing expedition. He paints it, as the news stories did, as a story of grit and survival. Yeah, I guess the victims of an ongoing ethnic war in Kyrgyzstan are well-to-do Westerners' who decide to climb a rock face in the midst of political unrest. Because whiteness is a card that says \"you can do whatever you want and go wherever you want.\" I have seen Tommy Caldwell speak three times. He likes to talk about the Dawn Wall, but never once mentions the history of the place. And I'm not talking about the climbing history. I'm talking about the Ahwahnechee people who were living in Yosemite before Europeans came and burned their villages, took their food storages, and killed them off or forced them onto reservations. Their descendants are living on those reservations today. So, why isn't any of this mentioned? After Tommy's presentation, I walked up to him, reached for the mic and asked him kindly, \"Tommy you like a challenge, right? What are you doing to dismantle whiteness in the outdoors?\" Then he got uncomfortable, kinda laughed, stumbled, grumbled, gave me a side-hug. The organizers cut the mic and I continued to ask my other burning questions, \"Just wondering your thoughts on that, and also, what is the historical context of you being in Kyrgyzstan in 2000? And I'm also wondering if you know anything about the Ahwahnechee people of Yosemite?\" Of course, the place was silent and Tommy was awkwardly laughing as I walked away, escorted out of the tent by one of the organizers. The point is that as white people we need to be talking about these things. I saw an opportunity to engage an important figure in the climbing community with these topics. We are not incapable of having these discussions, but sometimes it takes interrupting to create those spaces. Some people were not happy with what I did it, but Tommy was receptive and later said to me, \"I would love talk to talk more. I want to learn.\" P", "from - missing the crag after a two consecutive weekend trek and rapelling in waterfalls! see you sooner wall . . .", "from - Ever had one of those days where you FORGOT HOW TO CLIMB??

It's one of my favorites, and you can't really tell here, but I was pretty damn sick at the time.

I had to give up many, many foods and activities and take expensive, not so good for you drugs to keep it under reasonable control. The one thing I refused to give up was climbing, even though my body became so malnourished and weak that I could no longer climb what I previously was able to. I figured someday I would write about my experience with autoimmune disease, but because mine is intestinal, it's a little embarrassing to put something so personal as shitting 10 times a day out there into the public realm. But it is what it is and there are millions of people suffering from similar things. What compelled me to finally share this experience is my healing journey. You see, I am inherently an explorer and I applied that quest for discovery as a quest to find answers. Although it took a few years, ultimately I found answers, and as such, I must share them.

Photo Joe Meyer", "Above is Alice Purdy from Glenn Woodsworth, one was on Canada's leading climbers in the 1960s, who wrote this about her: \"From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Alice Purdey was the strongest female climber in B.C. and probably in Canada. She started climbing with the Varsity Outdoor Club (VOC) during her university days. She notched a good number of first ascents and new routes in the Coast Mountains, particularly in the Tantalus and Pantheon Ranges and the Pemberton and Ape Lake regions, not to mention half a dozen or so new routes at Squamish. She was on an unsuccessful attempt on the unclimbed north ridge of Logan in 1967. Her biggest climb was an ascent of rarely climbed Mt St Elias in 1971. Alice mostly climbed with friends from the VOC and the BCMC and with Dick Culbert. She and I did a few things together, mostly on a few VOC trips and at Squamish. Here she is on an early ascent of Papoose One with me in the fall of 1965, when the route still had plenty of trees and shrubs for belay purposes. Alice spent some years as a nurse in Hazelton, where she and Fred Douglas became good friends with Tom and Sys Richards. Later she and the family spent many years in Nepal, where she was involved in community health work; eventually Alice and Fred settled in Vancouver. Recently she coauthored the 7th edition of the ever-popular 109 Walks in B.C.'s Lower Mainland. Alice and I share a curious family link. During World War II, my parents and I moved to Port Alice on Vancouver Island: my father was the doctor for the entire north part of the Island. Alice was born there, with my father's help. Our mothers became good friends and kept in touch for many, many decades after, although I don't think they ever saw each other again.\"", "This is the great Amy Loughman from the book 'Learning to Rock Climb' published in 1982 and written by Michael Loughman. It reads, \"To help the beginner to develop technique, Loughman begins with an exposition of climbing movement that is brilliantly illustrated with sequence photographs of Amy Loughman climbing unroped on various problems at Indian Rock in Berkeley. These photographs are unique. They illustrate the fundamental principles of body position and weight transfer that every experienced climber knows, but which no one has described before in the literature.\""], "posts": ["BX8_Qiph2Co", "BX65wsQh6TL", "BXysk6bhJJV"]}, "4769019025": {"caption": ["Yay, the Castle Climbing Centre!

Something I really needed after such a hectic and stressful year, it all finally feels like it's coming to a close. Before leaving for Mauritius, even climbing was causing me stress. Elbow tendonitis flared up again, cracked rib, twinged knees, painful knuckles, over-stretched hamstring, and injured rotator cuff. I've been over training, and pushing myself too hard, only to injure myself and feed into a cycle of pushing myself more. I started to hate climbing. Now, I'm letting my body relax, and get lost in the nature here. After 2 weeks of rest, I've only now started to miss climbing.

It really resonated with me as most of my climbing struggle is mental, and pushing myself to persist and not let the thoughts of \"maybe I'm just not that good\" overwhelm me.

When you read multiple trip reports that state follow the Class 5 summit blocks to the top of the peak they are not referring to free soloing the 5.7/5.8 Gendarme (swipe right-dots are the ascent, green is my rappel). 2. When you get yourself into a sticky situation-breath and then solve the problem. 3. Be grateful you carried a 70m rope and can likely rappel of most things. 4. If it doesn't \"feel right\" as you're sketchily climbing up something that you thought would be mentioned in a trip report you're probably in the wrong route. Happy I was able to use my mountain skills (which are always growing) to safely climb this peak, despite a few hiccups. Disclaimer-I had a very detailed safety plan with a friend who was waiting at camp (@taisabrown), I was carrying a SPOT, first aid kit and a number of other pieces of safety gear. This was not my first solo summit and I was confident in my ability to deal with exposure and find my way to the top (which I eventually did). Know your limits and know your route.

On the flipside, Brian has been with the same company since he graduated college, so seeing him sticking with it was so confusing to me. I was a job hopper. 3-4 years max, and I was done. I couldn't do it any more. But then I started a photography business, and got my first taste of working for myself. That's when I realized that what I wanted in life was to be left alone. Not all the time- I mean, you have to have human interaction sometimes. But when it came to work, I wanted to do it on my terms. If I wanted to slack off, then I knew there was going to be a price to pay for it. If I wanted to edit until 1 in the morning, or wake up 5:30am to get the session delivered before I headed out to work, then I would. Because it was MY business, and that's how I wanted to do it. Not because someone told me to. Fast forward 5 years, and on this day last year, it was my first day as a full on entrepreneur. I put in my notice 2 weeks prior, and just like that, the chord was cut. So HAPPY QUITIVERSARY to me! And here's to another year of being able to work for myself. (With Camp Culture and AHP, of course!) Sometimes it's scary. Sometimes I want to cry. Sometimes I think about getting a job, just in case. When this happens, I hustle harder and longer, and pull myself out of the funk. It's not easy, and it's not pretty, but entrepreneurship was definitely my calling, and I just can't ever go back.", "Our hammock sticker is life. Your Yeti tumbler just isn't complete without it.

Like, planning a trip to watch the eclipse in SC, but not buying the glasses until a week before. I could've gotten them for $1 each locally, but instead had to buy them online for $35 for 4. I mean, why didn't I just buy them when we knew we were going to make a special trip to go see it? Because I procrastinate. And I pay dearly for it, lol. We have this tradition of heading up to SC for Brian's birthday every year, and every year, I order his present too late and have to pay for expedited shipping.

Yoga enhances climbing if you allow it to. Yoga and climbing both teach you to be present in the moment and with your breath. Using a pranayama breathing technique such as ujjayi breathing will calm your nerves and add oxygen to your muscles so you don't pump out. Ujjayi breathing creates heat and energy in your body. As you breath with intention and stay in the present moment you release fear and are left with beautiful flowing movement; a moving meditation. Your mind is so focused on the present moment you forget about your bleeding fingertips and aching muscles.

The photo on the right was me about 1.5 years ago. I was very sick and had been for years. You see, I have an intestinal autoimmune disorder (called lymphocytic colitis) which impacted my life and my climbing significantly. I lost so much weight and muscles mass I reduced down to a size 4. My climbing strength took a huge nose dive, and in order to do my favorite type of climbing, easy-trad-multi-pitch, I had to wear feminine pads or adult diapers. Embarrassing to admit publicly but it was my hellacious reality. But I refused to quit climbing. Climbing was my lifeline at a time when the world was looking really grim. I share this though, because I know there are millions of people who suffer from autoimmune disorders (MS, Lupus, etc.) and other types of intestinal disorders (many of which are also autoimmune - Crohn's, Celiac) and the message we get from doctors is take these expensive drugs (many of which which ultimately hurt our body more) and autoimmune disorders are incurable. That may be true , I may always have to contend with this, but I have hope - more than hope. Today I am back up to my normal size 8 and my strength is returning. This is thanks to a scientifically supported procedure I had 1 year ago, called a FMT - fecal microbial transplant. FMT is shown to help not just intestinal disorders, but many autoimmune disorders. But I had to leave the U. S. to do this life-changing procedure. I write about my experience in the September issue of Common Climber. The article is called \"How Autoimmune Disease Affected My Climbing\" and you can find it on the front page of Common Climber until the end of September (link in bio) or find it under the category \"mental-physical,\" or type in this link: http://www.commonclimber.com/autoimmune.html. in photo", "Sunshine on your face when you reach the top amplifies the celebration.

After regretting not pushing hard enough in my final race last season, we wanted to make sure I could at least be happy with my performance by knowing I really gave it my all this year- in every race. Though I wasn't entirely happy with my time and place in my first race of 2017, I was so bonked at the finish line, I had no doubts I pushed my limits that day. I looked forward to doing the same in the Ridge Run, but didn't win the lottery. I was suuuuuper bummed that I didn't get in, but decided to choose a new goal. A north face ascent of Granite Peak with my climbing and life partner, became the new dream, and I trained HARD consistently. Last weekend, we set off for our summit! We had a great start, though Mother Nature wasn't in the best mood. When the weather started getting formidable in a hurry, we reasoned (out loud) with her, telling her we respected her mountain, our own mortality, and begged her not to show us the fragility of it. She ultimately chose to be quite kind to us, and we rose after a rough, cold night to head to the peak. When we reached the saddle of Tempest and got a good look at our route, our hearts were heavy. The snow field we planned to either traverse or ascend to the base of the actual climb was twice as large as we had anticipated. (Evidently it had snowed 6 inches a few days before.) We weighed our options, laying out gear and discussing what the best route would be. Standing atop one mountain, feeling exceptionally insignificant looking at another, we ultimately decided to ascend Granite via the standard route. It felt like letting go of two of my dreams for my race season; first the ridge run, now the north face. But you know what? We are ALIVE and well, and we still summited!

Granted it's a really easy pitch BUT HEY, we all start somewhere . Being the worrywart that I am I was pretty nervous going into this climb but I'm also incredibly stubborn. If I say I'm going to do something bygonnit, I'm going to do it. So when held out a piece of pro I clipped it onto my harness and thought to myself, \"Alright, I guess we're doing this thang.\" To read more about my experience a new post is up on the blog - link is in our bio . Thank you so much to for all the incredible knowledge he has passed on to us this summer .", "Kyle and I have been talking a lot lately about travel and priorities and places we want to go. I know the world is full of amazing places but I can't get over the beauty that we are still finding so close to home. Countless people have asked us if we took a honeymoon after the wedding and our response is always the same: why would we leave the PNW this time of the year? Today, climbing Vesper Peak, there was a definite nip of fall in the air. Summer is ending but there are still plenty of beautiful weekends in our future. I love where we live.", "Scrambling is still a bit of a mental challenge for me. This last weekend we scrambled Hibox Peak near Rachel Lake and there were a lot of what I call \"crouch-y\" moments. AKA walking on a little ridge with some exposure and no rope makes me want to keep my body mass very low to the ground. I would rather climb something hard and scary with a rope than scramble around unroped. What's funny is after we got back we were chatting with some friends, another climbing couple, and both and I conferred, when we climb all we think about is falling. I imagine it over and over again. The guys shook their heads, falling never even crosses their minds. What a luxury! Regardless I am determined to improve my mental strength, think about falling less, get used to the exposure, and keep scrambling because let's face it, a great scramble can get you to some really wonderful places. PS Anyone else been out in the past week or so and discovered a swarm of bees, flying ants and lady bugs on a rocky summit? Like just on the very summit? Hibox Peak had them and apparently so did Del Campo... weird.", "Note: my butt patch. Yes, I'm asking you to look at my butt. But let me tell you- those pants have been well loved.

It means that we live a double life, where we work hard during the week to fill our current circumstances. But when the week is done there are two days which we can call our own, which we can fill with passion and fear and fresh air. Every day we try to build the best life that we can for ourselves but on these two little days we are our best selves. To be a weekend warrior is to create space for yearning and anticipation in your week and to embrace sweat, blood and tears on your weekend. It's to battle for what you love, even when you're tired and worn out, over and over again. We continue to fight the good fight, because with each passing weekend I know that it is worth it. P.S.

I've absolutely crippled my feet which were already covered in blisters from trekking but super happy. The guys took me to lunch at a local street food stall which was amazing! I'm really going to miss street food when I go back home. Planned to do my first multipitch in the afternoon but unfortunately, as is my luck, the rain came in and that had to be abandoned.

For some odd reason In my sleepy state I completely forgot about the approach and had to do it all in flip flops someone give me a brain please. Climbed through the cave to rappel the other side again and treated to stunning views of Railay. I love that climbing gives you a different perspective of things, even if it's just a different viewpoint of touristy places. Hiked back through the forest to the beach for lunch. In the afternoon I finally pushed myself enough to do some lead climbing so I could practice making an anchor today has made me realise how out of shape I am so determined to get training when I go home, at least it gives me something to focus on when I can no longer run around freely in the sunshine. Absolutely minging but super happy Feeling good after a good nights sleep, buzzing. Went climbing today. For a change nothing went wrong. Been a fun day, caving and climbing lots. Even managed a lead to practice making an anchor. Got back to Ao Nang and got myself an ice cream to sit and watch the sun set.

Follow my link in bio for my latest blog detailing all my session notes from projecting my first 8A. Thanks to for capturing the most memorable move on the problem. I dropped this move more times than I can remember. In Rocklands, I really learned how to climb at my full reach and this is a great example of that. When I first tried the prblem not only could I not do a single move, but this one felt too far. As I spanned the two holds, I felt a pulling in my shoulder. There was no way I could sustain a dynamic move to catch it. But then with practice, I realised that I could reach it. It was really the position of my body defining and shortening my reach. It's great to realise that shortness, at least for me, is often more in the mind than the body. To read all my session notes follow Link in Bio -- --", "to Fontainbleau earlier this year. It's not the end of the year, but since it was my birthday recently and I feel like I am getting old, I've taken this advacement into further wisdom to reflect...this year has been such a journey so far. 7 months on the road and so many adventures along the way. It started out in Font where I sent my first 7C Le Lot de Boudins to then advance two more grades. Which is just plain crazy. I never thought this doe-eyed girl captured by my good friend (and sick photographer) could ever amount to so much. No really, I totally feel the same. Which just makes me think even more that grades are so useless. I'm constantly a little positive champion of success in my own head. Maybe that's naiive but seriously people, you can do it!!

Another one coming shortly (like maybe tomorrow...) stay tuned. --", "I used to love tiny crimps like this one when I first started climbing because it felt like the only way I could have an advantage against others (mainly boys). Then once I made the discovery that I actually had man-hands (aka men's size L gloves) and that I could just crimp rather than that 'tiny girl fingers' that people use an excuse for any female who could crimp, I felt totally freed of this crimp-obsession. Now I like dynos, huge holds with huge moves, compression and gymnastic climbing.

How difficult it is to stand tall in the face of adversity when we are weighed down by the burdens of our own expectations, anxiety and self-doubt when we are competing with others. Maybe today we could try and set our heavy load down and see how it feels to know we are enough as we are and to free our arms and air out our hearts a little. Let them have a taste of the goodness around us when they aren't locked around the cumbersome baggage only we expect ourselves to carry. We might find we suddenly become feather light, adrift above the trivialities of wayward and temporal emotions knowing they can be left behind with our other needless parcels. Like the seemingly delicate lotus bud, born with all it needs to navigate through the darkness and uncertainty with just a glimpse of the lingering light of self-love and centeredness, we too have all we need to pull ourselves up from the depths and seek the light within. The Lotus emerges untouched by its dark past to rest unphased atop the muck, its face to the sun, feet firmly planted in the swampy soil; a recipe for happiness born from the mud. We can choose to look to the light, choose to be the Lotus, comfortable in muddy water. Maybe today we just try to turn up, to catch a glimpse of the light, and then maybe tomorrow with the kind reminder that, 'I am born with all I need, I don't have to carry anything more,' the journey upward can begin. . . . . .", "That time I was just kidding, I mean how can you take anyone seriously with shorts and a hat like that. . . . . . . . . . . .@youenjoymyshirt", "There are always things that I am welcoming to the light. They are always there, held teetering in tall towers, flying faded banners, discreetly labeled flaws. This time of year I am forced inward to begin the process of tearing down these towers from the castle of truth I built among clouds and continually attempt to crown 'Self.' The ruins often scatter and crowd my safely fielded confidence where I am forced to then dig out what I have subconsciously kept hidden in dark cracks and crevices, thinking as long as I can't see it, others won't either. And thus I am surrounded by the 'debris;' the remains of anything broken down or destroyed, like the emotional remnants of what is held up and exposed to the light when my curtains of protective walls have crumbled down. I find so much denial among it, trying to bury flaws I would rather discard than embrace as fault; like thinking needing help means weakness, not knowing the answer to a question somehow determines credibility, vulnerability in the unknown and unscripted, trying to control others because I question my own capabilities...and so on. But when it all comes crashing down what is left among the rubble; the cherished and the flawed, the bricks and the mortar. We can not build castles in the sky with lofty clouds of perfection and expect ourselves to stay standing. We must build on grounds of imperfection with stones of affirmation and the mortar of authenticity. A single, solid foundation that can house us through the long haul that is life and relationships, with ourselves and others; better this than to lie among the debris of denial, looking at the sky and wondering why teetering towers can't be held up by clouds. . . . . . . .#newmoon#virgomoon#virgoseason#autumnequinox#womenwhoclimb#womenwhoboulder#greatoutdoors#mountainlife#roadtripping#neverstopexploring#wildhairedanduntamed#coboulder#sheadventures", "Bathed in the awesomeness of pure unfiltered light; white crystal shards cut into the fluidity of a circle, encapsulating the darkest void of mind and self, that which is usually held back in shadow is now framed in illumination for all to see. .

In 1996, Arnaud Petit completed the pitch to the first anchor, and five years later, in 2001, became the first person to complete the line to the highest anchor, simultaneously sending the first ever 9a+. Thank you for giving Biographie / Realization to our community! In life, we are tested. Biographie tested my commitment, my fortitude, and my belief in myself. In May, I touched Biographie for the first time. Ever since, the route has been ingrained in my mind and body. In one week, I will leave France, the country that I have lived in and learned from for the past year. Just yesterday, I realized this dream. The difficulties of this endeavor were overshadowed by the sound of the birds, laughter of friends, and the changing of the seasons. To experience the delicate power that Biographie holds is a true privilege.

Mind you, I'm still very competitive, but it's more against myself than others. What that younger girl missed, this older girl now catches and understands and celebrates. It's the journey. Gratitude floods through me as I pause to listen to the sound of silence. Turning to face the sunshine I smile. This life is a short one, I know this surely. I'm grateful to have made it this far, with all of the stupid and wild risks and choices I made in the past. As I listen for the quiet sound of the wind gently blowing through the trees, I smile. This is living. This is a gift that many cannot partake in and I'm painfully aware of this.

I started teaching yoga when I was 18 and have been a teacher for 12 years now. Rock climbing came back into my life full force from teaching specialty yoga classes for rock climbers at Rock Spot. I find it complements the yoga practice well for me for two main reasons: 1. I've always had a hard time quieting my mind. Meditation was pretty difficult but somehow between the deep breathing and focusing on the next hold made me concentrate more than ever before. I find it to be a meditation in motion and for that I am grateful, it keeps me sane!! 2. I have never pushed myself as hard as I do lead climbing. I've never had an \"athlete mindset\" so for me to push past the barriers of my own mind really sucked for a while. Now, I feel like climbing not only has made me a better climber overall but a much better person. I can push myself in other aspects of my life a lot harder than in my past and I can tolerate a lot more overall. Working my hand strength has also made me a better thai massage therapist and guitarist when I'm performing on stage.

I'll be at the in Carbondale, CO this weekend to speak about my journey from idk-what-to-do-with-my-life to creating my own career in a space that matters (to me, at least). I hope you'll join me! My talk is on Friday, then I'll be speaking on a panel about environmentalism on Saturday. It's going to be rad. And I'm going to share ALL the embarrassing photos of young Katie being a gaper. See you there?", "I've stared at this picture for days, trying to find eloquence in expressing what this image means to me. Trying to squeeze out the poetry of what it feels like to have found the one you'd gladly be tied to all day while climbing up to an elevation your lungs have never sucked air at. The person who makes two dusty sleeping bags in the back of your trunk feel like home, and who pulls you back in when you start to slide out the back because you're sleeping on a tilt. Who always knows where to find the best cinnamon rolls in town, who never interrupts when you're writing in your notebook, who wakes you up every morning with a silent dance party, who finds their own joy in how joyful you are over things like little vegetables and big slugs. That person who is your numero uno belay pick, every time. The kind of human you adjust your sleep schedule for so you can be awake to read satellite messages from an expedition across the world. The one you want to share your proudest summits, lousiest failures, and roadside dinners with. This morning, I figured out the real depth of it: I learned how to cook the perfect fried egg for Brody, and if that isn't true love I don't know what is. (Eggs creep me out.) Gosh, this is gross. May we all find the kind of happiness that grosses us out.", "Excuses not to climb the Grand: my knees are busted, the smoke in the air was giving me migraines, I'm too slow, I'm not strong enough, I've never climbed a mountain this big, I was on my period. Reasons to do it anyways: because it turns out, I can. ____________________________________________________ Photo: the bestest safest climbing partner ever,", "I like standing on top of big, beautiful hunks of earth. Yesterday, my legs, lungs, and arms took me to the top of the Grand Teton--and safely back down--in a day. 14 miles of hiking, 2000 feet of alpine climbing, a surprise hail storm, two aching knees, and one funky oblong blister on my toe. A fine day to be alive in the mountains. I couldn't bring my whole notebook up with me, so I brought this little scrap of paper so I could write on the summit and just tape it in later, next to all the stamps I collected in the park. More from my adventure on the story today, go check it out! ___________________________________ Most folks we met on the mountain hiked out the day before, camped a night, then climbed. We just hoofed it car to car in 16.5 hours. I felt so proud of my body for pushing through what was easily the biggest day I've ever done, and grateful to Brody for encouraging me to climb the harder ridge instead of taking the 'easy' way up. It was exposed and tall and that one section with the overhanging crack was intimidating, but I reached the summit with heightened confidence in my abilities as a climber. For those who care: We left the trailhead at 2 AM, and got to the lower saddle just after sunrise. We climbed the Petzoldt ridge route, then rapped down 50' and traversed over to climb the Upper Exum to the summit. We down-climbed via the Owen Spalding route, with a little hail just after the belly roll section.

But I wasn't. I instead was just fumbling around on my leads and my follows, snot rocketing profusely because I was crying so much. I find the emotional highs and lows of climbing so incredibly interesting, and silly. So silly. Why on earth was I crying?! Was the climbing super hard? Super run out? Super scary?

Anytime I am on an adventure I feel so grateful and full of so much joy. I sat up on these cliffs and pondered life. I thought of how beautiful our planet is and how lucky I am to be living on it. Tons of mindfulness moments on yesterday's journey. I did tons of hiking and we were supposed to rock climb those cliffs... a bunch of mishaps happened, though, and we weren't able to repel down to get to the routes. Despite almost everything going wrong, we looked at the bright side: we were still adventuring and hiking in a gorgeous place, AND camping overlooking the cliff. Oh! And there was sunshine when it was meant to rain! We didn't get to climb but we found humour in the disastrous adventure. Why waste time being upset when you can't change the cards you are dealt? There's no point in being upset because it wasn't going to fix anything. Happiness lifted our spirits higher than the tallest point on that trail yesterday. Take time to sit in nature and observe, really observe, everything you feel, hear, smell, see... be present and truly in the moment -- you will soar! Living in the future or the past isn't where happiness lives.", "I swear I did one of her challenges September 2014 when I was living with my boyfriend at the time... but others are saying it was 4 years ago - it was definitely 3! Anyway-- so since we are being real and honest and vulnerable during this entire challenge here we go... this was taken yesterday, sept. 1st, when the challenge began. I had a horrible day at work and tried to find peace near a rooftop garden. Did a small flow for about 15 minutes during my break. It wasn't enough, though, even as I repeated the words \"do not let the behaviour of others destroy your inner peace\" as the day continued. After work I went bouldering at my local climbing gym. The frustrations of the day were still with me as I tried tackling routes on the wall... only becoming more frustrated and discouraged. \"F this, I'm going to do yoga.\" So I did yoga for about half an hour on their mats in the corner as I stretched my sore muscles... then I tried getting a sweet yoga pose shot. It wasn't happening. Rachel didn't want us focussing on poses anyway, so I stuck my feet in the air in the moment that I realized I didn't care and that it probably wasn't happening because this isn't what the challenge is about. This summer, so many things have brought me down -- it won't stop. Bad thing after another. They have all added up and lately all I want to do is lay on the floor like this and watch the sky, or in this case, a rock wall and ceiling. Where did my motivation go? Why am I struggling? I did lose my amethyst, four leaf clover AND a mala bead fell off my meditation mala sooooo... Now it's a new month, new changes.

In the order of achievement: a pink V4 on the roof that plagued me for weeks suddenly seemed pretty effortless; a blue V5 that I walked up to last week and flashed, so it begged for a repeat performance; and an orange V4 that I also flashed last week. That V5 is only the third V5 I've sent in my climbing career. I'm happy that V5s are starting to become doable and that V4s are in regular rotation. Not too shabby for less than three years of climbing, with only two or so sessions a week.

People look at me a little funny and perhaps wonder, how can you not remember the name of the climbs you have done? It's because I don't care which climb it is. To me it's just a climb, an incredible, amazing climb (ok, yes, there are some crappy climbs too...). But every climb gives me a unique experience in a unique moment which then absorbs into the millions of other unique moments that make me smile.

Like life, it works to our benefit to let go of expectations and face what we encounter when it presents itself - deal with it in the moment.

Make friends with fear, fail fast, celebrate successes, let go of perfectionism were just a few of the words of wisdom they shared.

Smith is best known for it welded tuff but there are over 400 routes on the basalt rimrock alone. Many of those routes are trad, but there are also a good number of sport climbs.

I think we all desire self-acceptance and would love for it to be whole and complete (instantaneous would be nice too...), but I have found I need to do it in bits and pieces. One part of myself that I denied for years (and even judged) was that I need to cry - if I'm tired I cry, frustrated or angry I cry, even when I'm happy I cry! When I finally let go of the self judgement (thinking that there was something wrong with me or that crying meant I was weak) and I accepted that I NEED to cry, I realized it how it helps me! I gain clarity after crying, I get renewed energy, and it allows me to move forward. My message to you: if you need to cry, do it! Even if you are in the middle of a climb (I have sobbed a-plenty in the middle of a climb!). Allow it to flow and you will be able to move on, to get the send or at least know what to do next. I posted a short video on this topic on the Climb-On Maps blog (link in bio) as well as on our FB page (@climbonmaps).
